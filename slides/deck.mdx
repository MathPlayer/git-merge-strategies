# Git Merging

---

### Types of merging

- Merge commit
- Rebase
- Squash

---

import { FastForwardExamples, NoFastForwardExamples } from "../components/FastForward"

## No Fast Forward Merge

- Will always result in a merge commit
- Doesn't matter if anything else has been merged in the meantime

<NoFastForwardExamples />

---

## Fast Forward
- Will never leave a merge commit
- Can only be done if no other work has been merged


<FastForwardExamples />

---

## Squash & Merge

import Merge from "../components/Merge"

<Merge />

---

## Rebase

import Rebase from "../components/Rebase"

<Rebase />

---

## Comparisons
---
### Fast forward vs no fast forward
- Requiring fast forward merges guarentees that the tests have been run against the code that will eventually be master
- Requiring fast forward merges means that all PRs need to be rebased and rebuilt after any other merge
---
### Squashing
- Loses commit information and so makes it harder for git to resolve conflicts
- If combined with fast forwarding it keeps the master branch linear
- Obvious place where PRs are merged
---
### Rebasing
- Keeps the master branch linear. Leaves all the commits from the feature branch on the master branch
- No obvious place where PRs are merged
---
### Merge commit
- Keeps the master branch clean (single commit for a whole piece of work) but not linear
- Keeps all commit history
- Obvious place where PRs are merged
